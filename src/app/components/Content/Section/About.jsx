        I am a sophomore majoring in informatics/computer science at Institut
        Teknologi Bandung. I have been interested in the study of computer
        science since high school. During my freshman year, I have been studying
        and growing myself in the fields of web development, software
        development, and data science. I have a strong will to learn and am
        passionate about new technology. I am also open to job and internship
        opportunities.
